# Crypto-Transaction
##Â Transaction for a non-existent cryptocurrency
## This is part of the creation of a new non-real cryptocurrency (along with the hash functions in the other project)

### These classes, Transaction and User, can be used to generate new transactions between users. These transactions have all the main features of cryptographic transactions.

1. They are inmutable and verified.
2. If something changes in the transaction after creation, the verification fails. 
3. They have the hasehs values of the sender and recipient (not trackable)
